## Translators

If you wish to translate the project into a language, just tell me in discord or create an [issue](https://github.com/bbfh-dev/bubblellaneous-pack/issues/new). You'll be able to change translation with a Google Sheet document or using your own editor that supports importing from `.tsv` files.

## Developers

If you wish to create your own fork / improve the project feel free to create pull requests.

You can find instructions on how to build project from source [here](./README.md#%EF%B8%8F-building-from-source).

The datapack logic / resourcepack can be found inside `src/` directory. `plugins/` contains generated parts of the project, the one you might be most interested in is `plugins/bubblellaneous/registry/...` for adding/removing content.

## Financial support

You can reach out to me if you wish to make a donation to help out the project.
